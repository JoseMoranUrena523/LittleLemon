# Meta Back-End Developer Capstone

Hello! This repository isn't to show/teach anything, I am currently doing a course on Coursera and I only have this repository to pass the course and extend my knowledge. Happy coding!

```  ## Note: Meta’s Documentation was a bit confusing so I had to play around with it a 
bit to get it working like it should.  ——————————————————
