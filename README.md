# Meta Back-End Developer Capstone

Hello! This repository isn't to show/teach anything, I am currently doing a course on Coursera and I only have this repository to pass the course and extend my knowledge. Happy coding!

If you are interested in trying out this API or is trying to grade my project, use the 
commands below to setup the project (assuming you are in the workspace directory):

```
source bin/activate
python3 manage.py runserver
```

If you are trying to grade my project, here are the endpoints for you to test:

```
/api/menu-items (GET/POST/DELETE/PUT)
/api/bookings/tables (GET/POST)
```

Note: Meta’s Documentation was a bit confusing so I had to play around with it a 
bit to get it working like it should.
